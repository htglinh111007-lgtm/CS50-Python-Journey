🐍 CS50 Python Journey
Welcome to my personal repository documenting my learning journey through "Harvard's CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python".  
This repo includes my notes, problem sets, and small projects built along the way.

📚 About the Course
[CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) is a free online course by Harvard University.  
It covers programming fundamentals including:
- Functions, variables, and conditionals  
- Loops and data structures  
- Exceptions and libraries  
- File I/O and unit testing  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Regular expressions and more

🧭 Goals
- Strengthen my Python foundation  
- Build creative problem-solving skills
- Share my learning progress publicly to track my growth and practice
- Apply Python skills to my field as an Artificial Intelligence major

💡 Future Plans
I plan to:
- Expand my “Practice” series with increasingly complex projects  
- Revisit and refactor earlier problem sets to improve code quality  
- Combine multiple course concepts into larger, real-world-style applications  
- Continue my learning path with "CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python"
- Explore AI-focused projects that connect my studies with practical coding experience
